1.1: Workout History to Calendar Tracker Feature

As a user, I want to see a visual representation of my workout history, so that I can keep track of my workout habits.
Elaboration: Users should have the ability to keep track of their workout history so we need a feature which allows that. Since calendars are already a great visual representation of habits we will use one to achieve this. 

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 3 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Perform a randomly generated workout with at least three working sets. Show that once the workout has been marked as complete, that day on the calendar will be highlighted with a bubble to represent it as complete.


1.2: Progressive Overload Feature
As a user, I want to see that I’m improving every time that I do a workout, so that I can keep making progress towards my fitness goals.
Elaboration: Users should have the ability to keep track of their previous workout stats, so that they can try to improve a little bit next time. Since progressive overload is widely regarded as one of the most fundamental tools to build muscle in the sports science community, we need a feature that will keep track of previous workout history sets/reps and will implement progressive overload by slightly increasing the difficulty of the next workout in the form of a greater weight (2.5/5.0 lbs +) or by increasing the volume of an exercise(35 total push-ups instead of total 30 push-ups).  

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Given a previous workout’s stats, perform a new workout session with exactly the same exercises. Show that the app has automatically increased the difficulty of the current workout by comparing the current difficulty to the previous workout’s difficulty.


1.3: Random Workout Generator Feature
As a user, I may not always have access to a gym and I want to be able to workout anywhere with or without equipment.  
Elaboration: Users should have the ability to decide whether they want to work out at a gym, at home, or even somewhere else. Some people may not always have access to all types of equipment so there needs to be an option to select what type of equipment is currently available to the user. This can be used to generate a workout for the user based on their workout requests and their specific type of equipment that they want to use. 

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 6 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Given a list of equipment available, generate a new workout based around those pieces of equipment and the other options that the user has inputted, such as number of sets and which muscles will be worked out.
